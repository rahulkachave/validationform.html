    <h2 style="color: red;"> key points in the history of Java programming language:<h2>
 <p>1. Java was first developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>2. The original goal of Java was to create a language that could be used to write software for consumer
     electronic devices, such as TV set-top boxes and handheld devices.</p>
 <p>3. The first public version of Java, Java 1.0, was released in 1995.</p>
<p>4. One of the key features of Java was its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) capability, which meant that 
    Java programs could be run on any platform that had a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without the need for recompilation.</p>
<p>5. Java quickly became popular for developing web-based applications and applets, which are small programs that run within a web browser.</p>
<p>6. In 2009, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, becoming the new owner of Java.</p>
<p>7. Over the years, Java has evolved and expanded to include a wide range of libraries, frameworks, and tools for
 developing a variety of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, enterprise software, and more.</p>
<p>8. Today, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages in the world, with millions of developers and 
billions of devices running Java software.</p>
