        <h1 style="color: red;">what ia java</h1>
        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that 
            was originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s.</p>
             <p>It was designed to be portable, meaning that programs written in Java can run on any platform that has a 
             Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without the need for recompilation.</p>

            <p>Java is used to develop a wide range of software applications, including web applications, mobile apps, enterprise software,
             games, and more. </p>
           <h2 style="color: red;">Some of the key features of Java include:</h2>
            
           <p> - Object-oriented programming: Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it allows developers to create modular, 
            reusable code that can be easily maintained and extended.</p>
            
           <p> - Platform independence: Java code can run on any platform that has a JVM installed, which makes it highly portable.</p>
            
            <p>- Automatic memory management: Java uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation,
             which makes it easier for developers to write code without worrying about memory management.</p>
            
           <p> - Security: Java has built-in security features that help protect against viruses, malware, and other security threats.</p>
            
            <p>- Large standard library: Java comes with a large standard library that includes a wide range of classes and methods
             for common programming tasks, such as input/output, networking, and more.</p>
            
           <p> Overall, Java is a versatile and powerful programming language that is widely used in the software industry
             for a variety of applications.</p>
